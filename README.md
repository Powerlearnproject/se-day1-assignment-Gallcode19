#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  Software engineering involves using engineering methods and  tools to develop,test,deploy and maintain software products systematically.
  Most industries are relying more on technology to facilitate their day to day activities, hence the adaptation of software engineering to develop softwares that meet their needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  Development of software engineering as a discipline  in the 1960s
  Introducton of Object-Oriented Programming involving representation of real entities with objects in the 1980s
  Agile Programming in the 2000s that saw the introduction of iterative programming with continous feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Requirements   : analysing, gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 Design         : creating a framework of the user interface and  system.
 Implementation : writing a set of instructions of how the system should work.
 Testing        : running the code to check if it meets the user needs and debug it.
 Deployment     : releasing the end product to the users and customers.
 Maintenance    : the continous process of updating and supporting the end product after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall involves a sequencial approach where each phase needs to be complete before going to the next little or no modification can be made. An authentification system 
  Agile involves an iterative approach that is flexible to change and modification. A report form  generation system.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 Software Developer        : writes the code and responsile for functionality implementation
 Quality Assurance Engineer: checks the system for defects and ensures that it meets the user needs.
 Project manager           : plans and ensures the software meets the timeframe and budget given.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs are tools that are used to edit,debug and compile codes e.g Eclipse that is popular with Java
 VCS allows programmers to monitor changes,collaborate and arrange projects e.g Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Bugs: fixing bugs encountereed in their code, thorough testing through a series of testing methodologies.
 Progressive changes in technology : networking and keeping tabs on the latest trends in technology.
 Security against  viruses : introducing firewalls,passwords, data encryption 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit testing: testing sinlge components of software 
 Intergration : testing relationships between subsystems or different systems.
 System       : testing the software all together.
 Acceptance   : checking whether the sotware meets user requirements.
 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Process of developing prompts to give instructions to AI models to generate the desired output. They are important to develop them prescise prompts to have more accurate responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  What to cook for dinner. A simple recipe for spaghetti and meatballs using only 6 ingredients to serve 8 people.
  It gives the AI a more specific prompt and it generates a accurate and relevant response.
